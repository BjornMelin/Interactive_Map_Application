<!-- Define the inputs that you will use -->

The goal of this graphic is to modify the graphic which was created for quiz 6 by making it so that you are able to see the county lines in state individually

                 selected = "Minnesota")
```


```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
